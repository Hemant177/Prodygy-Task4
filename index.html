            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a diligent Computer Engineer with a strong foundation in Java Python, and C++. My coursework and projects have honed my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. Through teamwork, I've learned the value of effective communication
                and collaboration. In my spare time, I engage in coding competitions, hackathons, and stay updated on new technologies to continuously enhance my skills in software development.

                <h3>Face Recognition</h3>
                <p>I have completed my first project in the Python language. We used a total of 5 Python libraries: opencv-python, dilib, numpy, face recognition, and cmake. This project is typically used in schools, colleges, and high-level industry meetings.
                    We have created a total of two files in this project.<br> The first file compares images of people and provides exact dimensions based on the matching images, returning a boolean value. The second file marks attendance. This project
                    first retrieves images and then checks whether people are present in the meeting or not. If the students are present in the meeting, their names and the time are filled in an Excel sheet</p>
